# Go Sec Labs Audits Reports 
Welcome to the official repository of **Go Sec Labs** public security audits.  
We specialize in performing smart contract and blockchain protocol audits across various ecosystems, including **EVM-compatible chains (Solidity)**, **Cosmos SDK**, and **Golang-based off-chain infrastructure**.

> Our goal is to foster transparency, security, and trust in the decentralized world by making our findings public and accessible.

This repository contains **publicly disclosed audit reports** conducted by Go Sec Labs.  
Each report includes detailed information about:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Architectural reviews
- Recommended mitigations
- Developer & security best practices

We audit projects from leading ecosystems such as:
- **Ethereum / EVM-compatible chains** (Solidity) / CosmosSDK etc 
- **Infrastructure Tools & Clients** (Golang)

## Disclaimer

> All audit reports provided in this repository reflect the status of the code at the time of auditing.  
> The audit does not constitute an endorsement of the project or its team. Projects must conduct continuous security assessments and follow secure development practices.

## How We Audit

Our audit methodology includes:
- Static Analysis / Dynamic Analysis / Fuzzing
- Manual Review / Threat Modeling
